The web application called "meatLess" was created with the purpose of assisting individuals
who aspire to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle or who are already vegetarians. Its primary function
is to monitor and record their meat intake, while also highlighting the various advantages such
as water conservation, reduction in CO2 emissions, and more. “meatLess” is built in the
programming language Python with the further aid of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
